Hi! I'm a comment too! Let's explore how to style your website with CSS (cascade style sheets).
CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed by the browser

body {
    /* 
    In here, we are telling the browser to align the text in the center of the page.
    The line "body { " is called a selector. It selects the HTML element you want to style.
    To select and element you can use the element name, class name (prefixed with . ) or id name (prefixed with #).
    Don't worry if you don't understand this yet, you will get the hang of it as you practice!
    
    You can also set the background colour to something different if you'd like -  just 
    replace #f0f0f0 with the colour you want, which you can find by searching for "hex colour picker" online.

    text-align: center;
    background-color: #445321bb;

.main-section {
    /* 
    This selector is for the class "main-section" in index.html
    We are telling the browser to add a margin of 20px (20 pixels) to the top and bottom of the element with this class.
    max-width: 600px; is setting the maximum width of the inner to 600 pixels, so it doesn't stretch too wide on big screens.
    width: 100%; is setting the width of the element to 100% of the "parent" (outer) element, so it takes up the full width of the page.
