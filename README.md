# Personal Website Template
This is a template for the Hack Club "Boba Drops" program being run as our first workshop session.

Welcome, club members! This is a simple template for your personal site if you've never touched HTML or CSS before. We'll be going through how to set up your own personal site using this template. Each file in this repository is a different part of the site, and includes comments explaining what each part does and how you can change it. To get started, download and unzip the repository, and open the `index.html` file
